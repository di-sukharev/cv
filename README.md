# DIMA SUKHAREV — CV

## Software Engineer

### Summary

I'm an open-minded fullstack engineer with 6 years of experience in software development and passion for elegant solutions to complex problems: from designing and building high-loaded apps to managing my happy marriage :)

I value sophisticated knowledge and engineering thinking over coding, so I have strong understanding of computer systems: from transistors quantum physics to cpu micro-architecture, operating systems, compilers and all that javascripts.

I created Applied Computer Science Simulator and mentored tens of junior coders into building critical engineering thinking through learning applied computer science principles.

I'm an author of [OpenCommit](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit) — open-source library for managing your Git commit messages with AI.

I also hired and managed a team of 5 people when I built whole tech for Tranzet startup, delivering together a complex product 4 months before launch deadline and saving ~50% of $500k budget.

I'm good at management, but I still love solving engineering problems too much. Anyway I will deliver tech value and build effective communication processes saving some men-days a month. Working at [deel.com](https://deel.com) I improved and reduced sprint planning time of 10 people for ~45 minutes, it's ~4 men-days a month, so yep :)

Although I believe empathy doesn't exist and feeling people is an illusion — I love communication and have a good ability of assembling interlocutors in mental models within my own experience, so if it's called good soft-skills — let it be it.
