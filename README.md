I am an open-minded fullstack engineer with 7 years of experience: assembled and led a team of 5 at Tranzet, delivering the product ~30% cheaper and ~20% faster; led projects and engineered systems handling over 100.000.000 queries per second at Alibaba; improved engineering processes and led tech parts of crucial projects at Deel. I have fun creating open-source hits — OpenCommit, winning GitHub Hackathons, sharing top-week articles on the web, tackling complex problems and working with unique individuals ❤
